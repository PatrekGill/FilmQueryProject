# FilmQueryProject

## Description
This program is a console application for interacting with a very limited portion of a film database. Users can search part of the database for films through IDs and keyword searches. The goal of this project was familiarization of both SQL and Java. SQL server used for testing was the free version of MAMP ran locally on the same machine. Also included are a few basic JUnit tests.

Unfortunately this project requires access to the relevant database in order to view its functionality.

## Technologies Used
Java 1.8, MAC OS, SQL, Eclipse IDE, Maven, JUnit 5, MAMP, Bash Terminal, and git.

## What I Learned
I primarily learned basic SQL, both at the command-line level and how it can interact with Java. Particularly the use of the `PreparedStatement` object. I had never touched SQL or databases as such prior to this. 

## Things That I Could Do Better
Less duplicate code. Still thinking about how to possibly structure the reuse of the similar try-catch structures while maintaining the nuances of each Prepared Statement and the ultimate return type.
